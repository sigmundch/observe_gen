## observe

An example implementation of data-observability using source code generation on
the side.

#### Status

We haven't yet implemented the code generation yet.  Both
`example/ui/app.g.dart` and `test/observable_test.g.dart` are currently
generated by hand, but they can be generated automatically using `source_gen` in
the future.

#### Unit test

To run the unittest, simply do:
```
dart test/observe_test.dart
```

The test shows a simple pattern of observability where notifications are
delivered synchronously. It also illustrates that you can observe complex
expressions in getters.

#### Sample UI framework

To show how this works in the context of a react-like UI framework, we built an
example under [example/ui/app.dart][]. This example shows a sequence of
modifications and how the UI is "re-rendered". This code runs on the
command-line, and the rendered UI is displayed as a single-line of text with
some color highlighting to indicate how the UI was rerendered on a fine-grain
level.

While the observe library issues notifications synchronously, the UI framework
batches changes to render the UI once every event loop.

Run this sample as follows:
```
dart example/ui/app.dart
```
